Optimized Lane Detection for Indian Roads  this project aims to enable real-time lane detection and vehicle tracking on Indian roads,
using machine learning to tackle severe challenges like poor lane markings, shadows, and expansion joints. The most difficult part was adapting the system to roads with 
inconsistent, fading, or non-existent lane markings, while ensuring robust performance under varying lighting conditions and road imperfections. Achieving high accuracy
in real-time, despite these obstacles, required developing advanced hybrid filtering and image processing techniques that could handle the unpredictable nature of Indian roads.
